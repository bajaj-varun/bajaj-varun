- **[aviation-ai-platform](https://github.com/bajaj-varun/aviation-ai-platform)**: An AI-driven POC platform to optimize operational efficiency for a global aviation client. The system unified disparate data sources—including flight manifests, cargo waybills, maintenance logs, and weather reports—into a single intelligence hub. By leveraging Generative AI and RAG, the platform automated critical support workflows, reduced manual lookup times, and provided real-time, context-aware insights to ground crews, cargo handlers, and operational staff.
